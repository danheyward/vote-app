# slacktivism

In these uneasy times, the call to make your stand has intensified to levels that I
haven't seen in my lifetime. However, I've noticed that there is a large section of
the population that needs more coercing to make a difference. Currently the phenomenon known as slacktivism, or the easiest form of social involvement, has been looked upon as an undesirable quality.
But what if we could turn this low-level commitment into a stepping stone, a way to introduce
the hesitant many into the world of social justice? That's where slacktivism the app comes into play.

1. ) Sign up with your registered voting address.

## The Plan

Initially, the app (affectionately called Bots & Prayers at the time) was meant as a tool to help users find the quickest and most affective way to the polls. Unfortunately the polling data I was able to funnel from the Google Civic Information API was not as compelling as I had hoped. Afterwards, I pivoted to an app to track your representatives voting records integrated with a quick-fire way to email them directly. Again, the API didn't quite have what I needed. Luckily a friend helped me refactor to the current app.

#### The Users

1. ) A young student, emblazoned by the latest school shootings, has felt that she didn't have an easy outlet for her voice. She wants a convenient portal to stay on the pulse and share her perspective while she anxiously waits for her 18th birthday.
2. ) A middle aged professional, embarrassed that he has neglected his civic duties up until this point unlike his much more socially aware friends. He wants a quickly accessible guide to help educate himself on the issues present to his reps today.
